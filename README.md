## Onboarding

The onboarding process for a new hire starts when the person accepts the offer, not when the person actually starts working. If you don't keep the conversation going on, you risk to lose them.

Some ideas to do before the person starts:
- Talk about the work setup the person needs.
- Ask the person to write a small introduction to be sent to the team they are going to work with.
- Send news about what is going on with the company.
- Add the person to the communication tools you are using (Slack, Teams, email, etc).
- Send information about the project.

You have to be wise in what you share and how much of it, but total silence needs to be avoided.
